This dataset consists of the following

Experiment 1

Train 1 - Has 100 timid from initial population - source: 3- EA-  Creating Uniques With Probabilistic Mutation/ Trial 4 P100G100
Train 2 - Has 100 timid from 100 generations - Source: 6-SimilarityVsEntropy/Timid_Intrapop_1000
Test - Has 60 timid from final population - Source: 6-SimilarityVsEntropy/Timid_Intrapop (Gen 499-501)
Train1 Updated has 100 timid from initial population - source: 3- EA-  Creating Uniques With Probabilistic Mutation/ Trial 5 -Just initpop size100 for 1 gen
Test 2 -  Has 100 timid from a 100th generation of a random run since there were errors in test dataset - ONLY TEST 2 to be used


Experiment 2:

Train 1 - Has 10 Intruder from initial population - source:Intruder/SimilarityCheck/Trials and other init pop
Train 2 -  Has 100 intruder from 100 generations - Source: Intruder/Trial691
Test  - Has 20 Intruder from final population - Source Intruder/Trial1726
Test 2 - Has 20 intruder from final population(gen600) - Source: Intruder/Trial691
Train 3 - Has 100 intruder from 100 generations - Source: Intruder/Trial1726

Experiment 2 - use test 2 when training with train 1 & train 2, use test when testing against train 1 & train 3
Experiment 1 - Ignore train1 and use train1 - updated
